# Pro Timer  (Productivity Timer)

### The no-fuss no-anxiety timer

- Most of the clocks are digital and it makes you conscious
- the non-digital tools available on the community show a red color timer for the timelapsed. its like an uncounscious anxiety inducer.
- this timer just shows a plain pi timer with dull colors even for the elapsed and remaining times

- This just displays a full screen pi chart timer. 
- Default value is 25min but custom value can be specified as a hash in minutes
- Double click anywhere and the timer restarts.
